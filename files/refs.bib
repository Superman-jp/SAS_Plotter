abstract = {Abstract Transparency is increasingly promoted to instill trust in nonrandomized studies using real-world data. Graphics and data visualizations support transparency by aiding communication and understanding, and can inform study design and analysis decisions. However, other than graphical representation of a study design and flow diagrams (e.g., a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials [CONSORT] like diagram), specific standards on how to maximize validity and transparency with visualization are needed. This paper provides guidance on how to use visualizations throughout the life cycle of a pharmacoepidemiology study—from initial study design to final report—to facilitate rationalized and transparent decision-making about study design and implementation, and clear communication of study findings. Our intent is to help researchers align their practices with current consensus statements on transparency.},
